# ToDo List Application Created by React

I'm creating a React todo list application, I have an input where users can type their tasks and them. 
typed tasks by the users get added to my tasksList state which is initiated as an empty array.
with each task I'm adding a checkbox and a delete button next to them. But I want to know how can I add functionality to these two.
How can I add checked tasks to an array called completed tasks?
